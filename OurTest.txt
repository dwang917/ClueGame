Our FileInitTests is largely the same with the examples in terms of tests because the example covers everything
that should be checked outlined in the description. However, we updated our test with the cells specific to our
board configuration. We checked the initials for "T, O, S, B, L", which stands for terrace, office, storage,
Bathroom and Laundry room. For the doorways, we checked all the directions. (6,5) is a door opens up to the
Master Bedroom, (4,8) is a door opens right to the recreation room, (3, 15) is a door opens left to the recreation
room, and (13, 2) is a door opens down to the guest bedroom. The total number of doorways for our design is 14.
And we tested the cell for label, center, unused and walkway.
